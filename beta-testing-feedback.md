**Date:** May 4, 2025

**Tester:** Melissa Vagi, Founder, Write-Brained Editorial Services LLC 

**Repository:** [https://github.com/vagimeli/docs-dev-test-repoTesting](https://github.com/vagimeli/docs-dev-test-repoTesting)

**Scope:** 6-hour beta test of Docs.dev’s AI content creation and usability for novice users and technical writers without software expertise, with a focus on plain language compliance.

## Overview
This report summarizes feedback from testing Docs.dev’s workflow for creating and auditing documentation. The test used a sample Python codebase (datasync.py) and a user guide (user-guide-original.md) in the docs-dev-test-repo. The goal was to check how well Docs.dev:

- Creates clear, plain language documents using AI.
- Helps novice users with setup, navigation, and editing.
- Supports technical writers without software skills in editing and auditing.Testing followed a 6-hour plan, including setup, AI generation, auditing, editing, and usability checks, as outlined in the repository’s README.

## Strengths

### AI Content Creation:
- [Example: Docs.dev created a clear description for sync_data in datasync.py, using simple words like “sync” instead of “synchronize”.]
- [Add specific strengths, e.g., “Included usage examples when prompted by Dev-Docs.JSON.”]


### Usability for Novice Users:
- [Example: The GitHub App setup was easy with step-by-step instructions in the quickstart guide.]
- [Add specific strengths, e.g., “Navigation buttons were clear and labeled simply.”]


### Technical Writer Support:
- [Example: The Markdown editor was intuitive, letting me fix passive voice without coding knowledge.]
- [Add specific strengths, e.g., “Auditor flagged jargon like ‘utilize’ correctly.”]


### Plain Language Compliance:
- [Example: AI-generated docs met Grade 8 readability when using Dev-Docs.JSON.]
- [Add specific strengths, e.g., “Checklist integration helped ensure active voice.”]



## Areas for Improvement

### AI Content Creation:
- [Example: AI missed adding usage examples for DataSyncClient.authenticate unless prompted multiple times.]
- [Add specific issues, e.g., “Generated docs used ‘authenticate’ instead of ‘log in’.”]


### Usability for Novice Users:
- [Example: The quickstart guide used technical terms like “repository” without explanations.]
- [Add specific issues, e.g., “No help button for stuck users.”]


### Technical Writer Support:
- [Example: Auditing tool didn’t suggest simpler words for ‘parameters’ in user-guide-original.md.]
- [Add specific issues, e.g., “No way to check readability scores in the editor.”]


### Plain Language Compliance:
- [Example: Auditor failed to flag passive voice in ‘shall be performed’ in user-guide-original.md.]
- [Add specific issues, e.g., “AI docs exceeded Grade 8 readability in some sections.”]



## Recommendations

### AI Content Creation:
- [Example: Always include usage examples in AI-generated docs by default.]
- [Add specific recommendations, e.g., “Use simpler synonyms like ‘log in’ for technical terms.”]


### Usability for Novice Users:
- [Example: Add a glossary to the quickstart guide for terms like ‘repository’.]
- [Add specific recommendations, e.g., “Include a ‘Help’ popup with tips for beginners.”]


### Technical Writer Support:
- [Example: Add a readability score tool to the Markdown editor.]
- [Add specific recommendations, e.g., “Suggest word replacements for jargon during auditing.”]


### Plain Language Compliance:
- [Example: Improve auditor to detect passive voice consistently.]
- [Add specific recommendations, e.g., “Integrate Flesch-Kincaid readability checks in AI output.”]



## Priority Bugs

- Bug 1: [Example: Docs.dev crashed when auditing user-guide-original.md with large code blocks. See Issue #1.]
  - [Add details: Steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, priority (High/Medium/Low).]


- Bug 2: [Example: Pull request for edited user-guide-original.md failed with a 500 error. See Issue #2.]
  - [Add details: Steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, priority.]


- [Add more bugs as needed, linking to GitHub Issues.]

## Conclusion
Docs.dev works well for [summarize key strengths, e.g., “creating clear code documentation”], but needs improvement in [summarize key issues, e.g., “novice usability and passive voice detection”]. The tool shows promise for technical writers and novice users, especially for plain language tasks, if recommendations are addressed.
