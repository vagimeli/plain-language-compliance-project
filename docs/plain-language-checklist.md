# Plain Language Compliance Checklist

This checklist ensures documentation complies with the Plain Writing Act of 2010 and plain language best practices. Use it to audit documents like `user-guide-original.md` with Docs.dev.

## Checklist Items
- [ ] **Audience Focus**: Is the content tailored to the target audience (e.g., non-technical users)?
- [ ] **Clarity**: Are sentences clear, using common words instead of jargon (e.g., “use” vs. “utilize”)?
- [ ] **Conciseness**: Are sentences and paragraphs short, avoiding unnecessary words?
- [ ] **Active Voice**: Is active voice used (e.g., “Install the software” vs. “The software shall be installed”)?
- [ ] **Structure**: Are headings, lists, and tables used for logical organization?
- [ ] **Readability**: Is the text readable (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level 8 or below)?
- [ ] **Actionable Instructions**: Are instructions specific and step-by-step?
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Does the document support screen readers (e.g., proper heading structure)?

## How to Use
1. Use Docs.dev to audit `user-guide-original.md` against this checklist.
2. Note issues (e.g., “Passive voice in ‘shall be performed’”).
3. Generate or revise docs to meet plain language standards.
4. Document findings in `docs/feedback-report.md` or GitHub Issues.
