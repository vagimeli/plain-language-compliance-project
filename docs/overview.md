# Overview of Plain Language Compliance Project

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the Plain Language Compliance Project, a beta testing initiative for Docs.dev, an AI-assisted documentation tool. The project focuses on evaluating Docs.dev's capabilities in generating, auditing, and editing documentation that complies with the Plain Writing Act of 2010.

## Project Purpose

The main objectives of this project are to assess Docs.dev's ability to:

1. Generate plain language-compliant documentation from Python code (`datasync.py`).
2. Audit existing documentation (`user-guide-original.md`) for clarity, active voice, and readability.
3. Support Markdown editing and GitHub workflows for compliance revisions.
4. Customize AI output using configuration settings (`Dev-Docs.JSON`) to meet plain language standards.

## Repository Contents

The project repository includes the following key components:

- `datasync.py`: A sample Python codebase for documentation generation testing.
- `user-guide-original.md`: A non-compliant user guide for auditing and revision.
- `plain-language-checklist.md`: A checklist for verifying plain language compliance.
- `Dev-Docs.JSON`: Configuration settings for customizing AI-generated documentation.

## Testing Scenarios

The project encompasses several testing scenarios:

1. **AI Generation**: Creating documentation for `datasync.py` using Docs.dev, with a focus on plain language compliance (e.g., active voice, avoiding jargon).
2. **Auditing**: Reviewing `user-guide-original.md` for issues such as passive voice or complex terminology.
3. **Editing**: Revising documentation using Docs.dev's editor to ensure compliance with `plain-language-checklist.md`.
4. **Feedback**: Reporting bugs and suggestions through GitHub Issues.

## Project Significance

This beta testing project is crucial for:

- Evaluating Docs.dev's effectiveness in producing clear, accessible documentation.
- Assessing the tool's support for technical writers and non-technical users.
- Identifying areas for improvement in AI-assisted documentation processes.
- Contributing to the broader goal of creating more user-friendly technical documentation.

## Getting Started

To participate in the beta testing:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/vagimeli/plain-language-compliance-project.git`
2. Install the Docs.dev GitHub App following the instructions at https://learn.docs.dev/docs.
3. Use Docs.dev to generate, audit, and edit documentation as outlined in the testing scenarios.
4. Document findings in `docs/feedback-report.md` and the GitHub Issues tab.

## Conclusion

The Plain Language Compliance Project serves as a valuable testbed for Docs.dev, aiming to improve its capabilities in creating clear, compliant documentation. Through this initiative, we hope to contribute to the advancement of AI-assisted documentation tools and promote better communication in technical writing.
