# [Docs.dev](http://Docs.dev) Beta Testing Feedback

## Tester Information

**Name:** Melissa Vagi **Date of Testing:** 05/18/2025 **Testing Environment:** Chrome, Windows 11, Login via GitHub, Testing repo: <https://github.com/vagimeli/plain-language-compliance-project>, [Docs.dev](http://Docs.dev) app: <https://app.docs.dev/ai-chat>

## General Impressions

**Ease of Setup & Onboarding:**

* Was the login process smooth? Were there any authentication issues? **Yes, the login process took a few seconds and involved minimal steps (Stephen provided a three-step guide with links on getting started). No authentication issues occurred.**

* Did the onboarding instructions offer sufficient guidance? **Yes, I followed the path for users with documentation. The ability to establish a new documentation repository is beneficial for individuals who lack an existing repository for connection. It serves as an excellent resource for those who are new to open-source documentation and the concept of documentation as code. The Quickstart guide is straightforward and uses simple language, ensuring that getting started requires minimal effort.**

* Was the dashboard easy to navigate? **Yes. Below is a screenshot of my UI view.**

**Overall User Experience:**

* How easy was it to find the key features? **The main menu navigation includes five streamlined options. The naming convention clearly reflects what each option offers to the user. I found the GitHub, Notion, and Slack integrations particularly useful because they are the tools I most commonly use in collaborative writing environments. Setting up GitHub was straightforward because the buttons indicated which steps to follow.**

* Were UI elements logically placed and well-labeled? **The UI is straightforward and user-friendly. Buttons are correctly labeled according to current UI writing conventions.** 

* Any confusing workflows or friction points? **None caused by the UI itself. Confusion was due to my own learning curve with the platform and its interface. I struggled with locating correct buttons or features** **Below is a screenshot of my UI view.** **I want to understand the features of Editor Settings better. The default setting is Off. I turned them all on for testing purposes. Are there any suggested configurations to enable? What are the use cases for these configurations?**

## Feature-Specific Feedback

**Live Web Editor**

* Did markdown editing work as expected? **Yes. I**

* Was the preview feature reliable and accurate? **Yes.**

* Were formatting tools intuitive and responsive?

**Collaboration & GitHub Integration**

* Was syncing with the private GitHub repo seamless? **Yes. The one-click buttons helped me choose the repositories I wanted to link with the&#x20;**[**Docs.dev**](http://Docs.dev)**&#x20;app. I linked both a private repository and a public one. These selections were completed in seconds.**

* Were version control tools effective? **Yes. I found the one-click “Generate changelog” feature incredibly helpful for quickly summarizing file changes in the app. Instead of having to log into GitHub and search through the repo to check the changelog, this app eliminates those manual processes.**

* Did change tracking and rollback features function correctly?

**AI-Assisted Features**

* Was AI assistance relevant and helpful? **Yes. The AI assistance was particularly effective at expanding on initial prompts, automating pull request creation, and detecting when code changes required documentation updates. This proactive approach helps maintain documentation currency without manual monitoring.**

* Did AI-generated content match expected technical standards? **Yes. The initial drafts included the foundational information at a high level. This approach improved my writing by starting from a draft instead of a blank page.**

* Any incorrect or misleading suggestions? **No. I used the AI assistant to generate the first drafts of the project overview and get started documents.**

* Did the text-to-speech feature work effectively?**&#x20;Yes, the read-aloud functionality was surprisingly natural and human-like rather than robotic. It correctly handled punctuation pauses and used proper questioning intonation for headings like "Was AI assistance relevant and helpful?" The natural pacing made it easy to catch errors during document review, and it handled technical terminology without stumbling over complex words or acronyms - which is particularly valuable for accessibility compliance with my government clients.**

**Code Context & GitHub App**

* Did embedded code snippets display correctly?

* Did the platform properly recognize contextual code references?

* Any issues with permissions or repo selection? **None.**

## Performance & Reliability

**Speed & Load Times**

* Did performance vary across browsers or devices? **Yes, I tested it on my laptop using Chrome and Edge.**

**Error Handling & Bugs**

* Were error messages clear and helpful? **Yes, I received an error message about not connecting my docs repo to the&#x20;**[**Docs.dev**](http://Docs.dev)**&#x20;app. I missed a step in the connection process but resolved it in a few seconds.**

* Did any unexpected behaviors occur? **No.**

## Additional Observations & Suggestions

**Missing Features or Enhancements**

* What features would improve usability? **Step-by-step tutorials for common docs-as-code use cases.**
