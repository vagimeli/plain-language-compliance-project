# [Docs.dev](http://Docs.dev) Beta Testing Feedback

## Tester Information

**Name:** Melissa Vagi **Date of Testing:** 05/18/2025 **Testing Environment:** Chrome, Windows 11, Login via GitHub, Testing repo: <https://github.com/vagimeli/plain-language-compliance-project>, [Docs.dev](http://Docs.dev) app: <https://app.docs.dev/ai-chat>

## General Impressions

**Ease of Setup & Onboarding:**

* Was the login process smooth? Were there any authentication issues? **Yes, the login process took a few seconds and involved minimal steps (Stephen provided a three-step guide with links on getting started). No authentication issues occurred.**

* Did the onboarding instructions offer sufficient guidance? **Yes, I followed the path for users with documentation. The ability to establish a new documentation repository is beneficial for individuals who lack an existing repository for connection. It serves as an excellent resource for those who are new to open-source documentation and the concept of documentation as code. The Quickstart guide is straightforward and uses simple language, ensuring that getting started requires minimal effort.**

* Was the dashboard easy to navigate? **Yes. Below is a screenshot of my UI view.**

**Overall User Experience:**

* How easy was it to find the key features? **The main menu navigation includes five streamlined options. The naming convention clearly reflects what each option offers to the user. I found the GitHub, Notion, and Slack integrations particularly useful because they are the tools I most commonly use in collaborative writing environments. Setting up GitHub was straightforward because the buttons indicated which steps to follow.**

* Were UI elements logically placed and well-labeled? **The UI is straightforward and user-friendly. Buttons are correctly labeled according to current UI writing conventions.** 

* Any confusing workflows or friction points? **None caused by the UI itself. Confusion was due to my own learning curve with the platform and its interface. I struggled with locating correct buttons or features** **Below is a screenshot of my UI view.** **I want to understand the features of Editor Settings better. The default setting is Off. I turned them all on for testing purposes. Are there any suggested configurations to enable? What are the use cases for these configurations?**

## Feature-Specific Feedback

**Live Web Editor**

* Did rich text editing work as expected? **Yes. I tested both the Rich Text editor and the raw Markdown view. The Rich Text editor is the primary writing tool and functions like familiar word processing software with standard formatting shortcuts. While you can view the raw Markdown code that's generated, the platform focuses on Rich Text editing rather than direct Markdown editing. This approach works well for writers who want Markdown's clean output without needing to learn the syntax.**

* Was the preview feature reliable and accurate? **Yes. The preview consistently matched the final output without any formatting discrepancies.**

* Were formatting tools intuitive and responsive? **Yes.&#x20;****The formatting tools responded immediately and followed standard conventions that writers expect.**

**Collaboration & GitHub Integration**

* Was syncing with the private GitHub repo seamless? **Yes. The one-click buttons helped me choose the repositories I wanted to link with the&#x20;**[**Docs.dev**](http://Docs.dev)**&#x20;app. I linked both a private repository and a public one. These selections were completed in seconds.**

* Were version control tools effective? **Yes. I found the one-click “Generate changelog” feature incredibly helpful for quickly summarizing file changes in the app. Instead of having to log into GitHub and search through the repo to check the changelog, this app eliminates those manual processes. The autosave to GitHub feature is particularly smart---it automatically commits changes without disrupting my writing flow.**

* Did change tracking and rollback features function correctly?**&#x20;I didn't see these features as currently available in the platform, but they would be valuable additions---especially for teams managing complex documentation workflows where the ability to track specific changes and revert to previous versions would enhance collaboration and reduce risk of content loss.**

**AI-Assisted Features**

* Was AI assistance relevant and helpful? **Yes. The AI assistance was particularly effective at expanding on initial prompts, automating pull request creation, and detecting when code changes required documentation updates. This proactive approach helps maintain documentation currency without manual monitoring.**

* Did AI-generated content match expected technical standards? **Yes. The initial drafts included the foundational information at a high level. This approach improved my writing by starting from a draft instead of a blank page.**

* Any incorrect or misleading suggestions? **No. I used the AI assistant to generate the first drafts of the project overview and get started documents.**

* Did the text-to-speech feature work effectively?**&#x20;Yes, the read-aloud functionality was surprisingly natural and human-like rather than robotic. It correctly handled punctuation pauses and used proper questioning intonation for headings like "Was AI assistance relevant and helpful?" The natural pacing made it easy to catch errors during document review, and it handled technical terminology without stumbling over complex words or acronyms - which is particularly valuable for accessibility compliance with my government clients.**

## Performance & Reliability

**Speed & Load Times**

* Was the editor responsive? Any noticeable lag? **Yes, it loaded immediately.**

* Did performance vary across browsers or devices? **Yes, I tested it on my laptop using Chrome and Edge.**

**Error Handling & Bugs**

* Were error messages clear and helpful? **Yes, I received an error message about not connecting my docs repo to the **[**Docs.dev**](http://Docs.dev)**app. I missed a step in the connection process but resolved it in a few seconds based on the error message.**

* Did any unexpected behaviors occur? **Yes. During testing, I encountered difficulties with the changelog generation feature despite successfully connecting both private and public repositories using the one-click integration buttons. While the initial repository connection appeared successful, the "Generate changelog" function didn't work as expected, suggesting there may be a gap between the connection process and full feature activation. It would be helpful to have clearer confirmation indicators showing when a repository is fully integrated, along with troubleshooting guidance for common integration issues and a step-by-step verification process to ensure the connection is complete before attempting to use advanced features. While this didn't impact my overall positive experience with the platform, resolving this integration clarity would prevent confusion for other beta users.**

## Additional Observations & Suggestions

**Missing Features or Enhancements**

* What features would improve usability? **Step-by-step tutorials for common docs-as-code use cases. Additionally, this tool would significantly reduce documentation maintenance overhead for my government clients who require frequent compliance updates and audit trails.**

* Any workflow improvements needed? **The app met my documentation needs.**  

**Comparison with Demo Videos**

* Did actual functionality match demo expectations? **Yes. The demos and documentation, such as the guides for connecting my docs repo, provided essential information and demonstrated the features in use.**  

* Any inconsistencies between what was demonstrated and actual use? **I had no issues. The guides were accurate in the setup process and enabled me to get started within minutes.**

**Final Rating & Summary**

* Overall usability score (1-10): **8**
